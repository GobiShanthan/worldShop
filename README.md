## Reflections
  
  
  -  This was a great experiance becuase, this project taught me 	to better manage my time.
  - Time is the biggest issue for me. I need more time to 	implement all the features i had in mind.


## Optimizations
  
  
  -  React Suspense to lazy load pics and components.
  -  rtk query for requests (load initial state before app loads)
  - custom pagination complete, but would love to add sort and 	filter, and find methods.
  - Time is the biggest issue for me. I need more time to 	implement all the features i had in mind.
